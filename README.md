# signalk-triplogger

This plugin keeps automatic track of the distance traveled on the current trip. The distance tracked is based on vessel GPS positions, so it tracks distance over ground, not distance over water like traditional paddlewheel logs.

The plugin monitors vessel `navigation.state` as set by the [signalk-autostate](https://github.com/meri-imperiumi/signalk-autostate) plugin. Trip recording ends when vessel is detected as anchored or moored, and when vessel again gets under way, the trip log is reset to 0NM. **Install the autostate plugin or ensure your `navigation.state` is correctly set to use this plugin.**
